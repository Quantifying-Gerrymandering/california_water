The file "ca-water.zip" includes an ESRI Shapefile containing all water areas between 32째N and 43째N, and betweeen 114째W and 125째W. This bounding box contains all of California.

The file includes two features, one for the Pacific Ocean, and the other for "inland perennial" water bodies (i.e. lakes and rivers). This allows the ocean to be distinguished from non-ocean water bodies.
